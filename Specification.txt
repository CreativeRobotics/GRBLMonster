GRBL Monster. An over the top PCB for GRBL designed for the SAM D21.

•	Fully compatible with Arduino UNO and GRBL.
•	Enhanced options for Sparkfun SAMD21 development board
•	Four axis stepper drivers using POLOLU stepper boards (A,X,Z and R) with up to two drivers per axis. 
  o	‘R’ axis drivers can be split in two to create a fifth axis when using the SAM D21 board
•	Four limit switch inputs (X,Y,Z and R)
•	DIP switches for micro step configuration (A,Y,Z and R)
•	Two stepper boards per axis (total of 8).
•	Stepper drivers are arranged in two groups of four:
  o	Mounting holes for one 60mm cooling fan per group.
  o	Individual or single power supply for each group.
•	Four SPI headers for each axis to allow for SPI based stepper drivers.
•	Spindle, coolant and probe headers.
•	Transistor output option for driving a spindle relay.
•	On board 12V regulator for cooling fans and relays.
•	Additional header with SPI, UART, Hold, Resume and Reset pins for control buttons or pendant.
•	Functional design:
  o	Easy to implement forced cooling for drivers.
  o	Power input, driver outputs, limit switches, spindle, coolant, probe and relay outputs are all on one edge of the PCB.
  o	USB connector, dip switches and pendant header are all on the opposite edge.
